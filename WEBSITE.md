## Static Rendering and Web Deployment

This repository contains the set of artifacts that make up the normative
and non-normative sections of the Decentralized Claims Protocol. All artifacts are
bundled by the [respec framework](https://www.respec.org) which takes care
of rendering a static website.

### Conventions

The following extensions to the basic markdown syntax are used in this
specification project. Keep them handy and navigating the document will
be easy.

- Referencing an external specification document. [Respec Docs](https://respec.org/docs/#references-0)
    - with identifier inline `[[foreign-spec-id]]`
    - with the foreign spec's display name inline `[[[foreign-spec-id]]]`
    - referencing a particular section in a remote document works via ordinary markdown links. The reference has to be
      added to the `References` section manually (if it's not already there).
- Defining terminology: A term is defined by wrapping it in
  `<dfn>Defineable</dfn>`. [Respec Docs](https://respec.org/docs/#definitions-and-linking)
- Custom section IDs: If various sections have the same heading, they must be given a unique id manually via
  `{#my-custom-section-id}` that can then be used for referencing
  it. [Respec Docs](https://respec.org/docs/#example-specifying-a-custom-id-for-a-heading)
- Referencing within the document. Please note that despite separation in multiple markdown files, there is only one
  html document. References to sections must be flat `(#section)` instead of path-based
  `../specifications/verifiable.presentation.protocol.md#presentation-flow`.
    - with the sections number and display name inline `[[[#my-section-id]]]`
    - If that's not desired, ordinary links work as well. `[my custom link](#my-section-id)`
    - referencing terminology: `[=Defineable=]`. This will work out of the box with Plurals such that `[=Definables=]`
      refers to the definition of `<dfn>Defineable</dfn>`.
- Code blocks work natively like in markdown.

### Rendering in your IDE

1. Locally execute `mkdir resources` `cp -r ./artifacts/src/main/resources/* resources` from the repository root.
2. Open the `index.html` file.
3. Your IDE should have a feature to display html documents (either in your browser of choice or inline). Use that and
   you should always see the updated webpage when saving.

### Publishing versions

When wanting to pin and publish a snapshot in time via a separate url-path, follow the appropriate steps listed below.

#### Prep commits

When the content is finished, a release requires a first commit with

1. a tag with the exact version string (like `v1.0-RC1`) on the release commit
2. to change the redirect in `.github/scripts/index.html` to point to latest release candidate
3. set the `respecConfig.publishDate` in `index.html` to a string like `"2025-02-27"`,`
4. set the `respecConfig.specStatus` in `index.html` to `base`

In case of versions with a new namespace, additionally:

5. adjust the textual description of the context URI in the base spec
6. appended w3id referrals

and then (independently of major/minor) a second commit

1. setting the specStatus config option to `unofficial` and
2. increase the spec version in the title of `index.html`
3. remove the release date

#### Push and build

- Open a PR with both commits. Wait for it to be merged. 
- Push the tag to origin/main on Github. 
- Rerun the actions.

You should now see an additional endpoint at `https://eclipse-dataspace-dcp.github.io/decentralized-claims-protocol/my-version-tag/`.
